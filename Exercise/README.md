# DCGANs
Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks Exercise

## Introduce
In our introduction to generative adversarial networks (GANs), we introduced the basic ideas behind how GANs work. We showed that they can draw samples from some simple, easy-to-sample distribution, like a uniform or normal distribution, and transform them into samples that appear to match the distribution of some data set. And while our example of matching a 2D Gaussian distribution got the point across, itâ€™s not especially exciting.
